I believe he’s best suited to play guard at the next level. In pass pro, he has quick feet, stays square and catches/absorbs rushers. His lack of length shows up on the perimeter. He allows defenders to capture his chest, but he still possesses the core strength and balance to stall their push. He shows the savvy to snatch rushers when they get overextended. I love his ability to fit up and drive defenders in the run game. He has a great feel on combo blocks, and he always looks to finish. He has a nasty playing style, but he doesn’t get caught off-balance. Overall, I see Zabel as a Day 1 starter at guard. -- Daniel Jeremiah, NFL Network",

    analysis: "Majors is a short-armed, center-only prospect. He’s technically sound and plays with poise and control. He’s athletic enough to lead the charge around the corner and can get into the second level. He has neutralizing core strength but that won’t mean much against NFL two-gappers who can strike and control him when singled up. He’s a coach’s dream with a high football IQ and operational toughness. He punches with inside hands and a well-balanced base to immediately stall early bull-rush tries. Majors is smart, tough and reliable with the potential to eventually become a starter. -- Lance Zierlein, NFL.com",

Prather is not explosive -- though he builds and carries speed to create deep windows -- and needs to do a better job of finishing routes and catches. He’s too leggy and tight-hipped to beat man coverage over the first two levels and he’s not a natural pass catcher in traffic. Prather is a niche option as a field-stretcher with good height, weight and speed, but he might need to prove he can play special teams to give himself a legitimate roster shot. -- Lance Zierlein, NFL.com",

    analysis: "Despite physical and athletic limitations, Higgins racked up tackles and awards over the last two seasons. He’s built like a downhill running back and delivers power behind his pads like one. Instincts feed his gaudy production, but a lack of length and twitch lead to him getting stuck on blocks when he’s not playing downhill. He lacks change-of-direction quickness and isn’t fast enough to capture outside runners. Higgins shouldn’t be asked to handle man coverage as a pro, but he’s above average as a zone defender. He has three-down talent and coverage value but his limitations create small margins for error and large obstacles to overcome. -- Lance Zierlein, NFL.com",

Dike is a second- and third-level receiver whose routes have the energy of a youngster on a playground with all gas and no brakes. He is an early separator with his speed but won’t see nearly as many free or schemed releases as he saw at Florida. He catches with downfield focus and good toughness when contested but doesn’t always play with catch-ready hands, which will lead to frustrating misses. He’s more of a field-stretcher than a volume option, but his talent for opening intermediate and deep windows could appeal to teams in need of speed. -- Lance Zierlein, NFL.com",
